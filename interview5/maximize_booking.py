Given a set of numbers in an array which represent number  of consecutive days of AirBnB reservation requested, as a host, 
pick the sequence which maximizes the number of days of occupancy, at the same time, leaving atleast 1 day gap in between 
bookings for cleaning. Problem reduces to finding max-sum of non-consecutive array elements. // [5, 1, 1, 5] => 10 
The above array would represent an example booking period as follows - // Dec 1 - 5 // Dec 5 - 6 // Dec 6 - 7 // Dec 7 - 12 
The answer would be to pick dec 1-5 (5 days) and then pick dec 7-12 for a total of 10 days of occupancy, at the same time, 
leaving atleast 1 day gap for cleaning between reservations. Similarly, // [3, 6, 4] => 7 // [4, 10, 3, 1, 5] => 15
